    <h2>What is Epilepsy?</h2>
    <p>
        Epilepsy disease (also called an epileptic seizure disorder) is a long-term brain condition with repeated
        seizures
        (also called fits - a sudden change of neurologic function due to neurons' excessive discharge).
        A single seizure is not treated as an epileptic seizure.<br><br>

        Epilepsy came from the Greek word epilambanein, meaning "to be seized." It implies the magical thinking of
        that time that people with epilepsy were considered unclean or evil and created the stigma related to epilepsy.
    </p>

    <h3>Epilepsy in India</h3>
    <p>
        According to various studies, it is estimated that the overall prevalence of epilepsy in India is 5.59-10 per
        1000.
        According to a study conducted by Bharucha et al. in India, a more significant number of males are affected by
        epilepsy.
        The prevalence in males (5.1 per 1000) was significantly greater than in females (2.2 per 100).
    </p>

    <h3>Types of epilepsy</h3>
    <p>
        The most recent classification model is the 2017 classification of seizures and epilepsies by the International
        League Against Epilepsy (ILAE). It helps patients and their caregivers easily understand seizures that have both
        focal and generalized onset, including missing seizures. The revised epilepsy classification is a multi-level
        classification and is classified into four main types:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Focal</li>
        <li>Generalized</li>
        <li>Combined Generalized and Focal</li>
        <li>Unknown Epilepsies</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Epilepsy diagnosis</h3>
    <p>
        Generally, it is quite challenging to diagnose epilepsy quickly because similar symptoms can be seen in
        migraine, fainting, and panic attacks; below are some of the tests to diagnose epilepsy:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Blood tests</li>
        <li>Electroencephalogram (EEG)</li>
        <li>Computed Tomography (CT) scan</li>
        <li>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan</li>
        <li>Positron Emission Tomography (PET)</li>
        <li>Neuropsychological Assessment</li>
        <li>Intracarotid Memory and Speech Evaluation (Wada test)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Epilepsy Symptoms</h3>
    <p>
        Although epilepsy symptoms mainly consist of the generalized occurrence of seizures, there are several factors
        that differentiate epilepsy and seizure disorder. Epileptic seizures vary from person to person. Anyhow, it is
        quite common for an aura to manifest before the initiation of a seizure. Aura includes symptoms such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Abnormal smells</li>
        <li>Fear sensation</li>
        <li>Increased epigastric sensation</li>
        <li>Paraesthesiaâ€™s (abnormal sensation of the skin that can feel like tingling, numbness, burning, or pricking)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The following are seen in the postictal state (a state that follows generalized onset seizures, which lasts from
        minutes to hours):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Headache</li>
        <li>Confusion</li>
        <li>Deep sleep</li>
        <li>Muscle soreness</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Epilepsy Treatment</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Nonpharmacological Treatment:</strong> 
            A special diet (ketogenic diet) that can help control seizures.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Pharmacological Treatment:</strong> 
            Medicines called antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Surgical Management:</strong> 
            Surgery to remove a small part of the brain that's causing the seizures.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Interventional Treatment:</strong> 
            A procedure in which a small electrical device is inserted in the body that can help control seizures.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Our Solution</h3>
    <p>
        This project introduces an advanced prediction system utilizing machine learning, specifically 
        the Random Forest algorithm, to analyze epilepsy-related data. By collecting and processing 
        key health and lifestyle indicators, our platform provides accurate, data-driven insights 
        into epilepsy prediction, detection, and management success probability.
